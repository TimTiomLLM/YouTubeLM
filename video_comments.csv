"Where would you put Hukportie that went to the Knicks. He’s been much better than expected. Once he figures out how to stop fouling so much he can be a defensive beast. 
Zach eddy has the same foul trouble issues as well though."
"Umm…yes, I’m a Wolves homer, but I can honestly say that Rob Dillingham is a breath of fresh air and I wouldn’t re-pick anyone else in this draft. He’s quick and flashy, exciting to watch. He’s still too skinny and his defense needs work, but this guy has the potential to be a star in this league. One thing is for sure: Dilly is NO bust. Coach Finch just needs to play Dilly more, and that’s on Finch—not on Dillingham. 

If Dilly were in a faster, run ‘n’ gun offense of, say, Don Nelson’s, Rob would be a 20-22 ppg / 7-8 asst guy every night. When Mike Conley finally retires at the end of the season, you’ll see a big change in how the Wolves operate as Dilly will get all those minutes…and he’ll bloom right before our eyes. It’s coming. Don’t miss it!

Also, Terrence Shannon Jr. is a stud, and he’s gonna be a 20 ppg / 7-8 rebounds per game guy, too. If you add him to this re-draft list, he’d be in the top 10, too…likely top 7. Again, it’s Coach Finch holding him back. Get the man more playing time, and we’ll see…just like we saw the other night as the Wolves came back from 25 down to beat the Thunder in OT. That wasn’t a fluke, folks. TJ is relentless on offense. He doesn’t stop.

The sky is the limit for these two young guys on the Wolves. Add in 2nd year man Jaylen Clark’s defense and the Ant Man…woah."
liked and subbed cuz of the magic shirt
tiktok dancer outplaying pandemic p bruh
devious work with the highlight package to shoe in your narrative
Dalton Knect should've been 1 or 2
I don't get some of these. How is it a regrade is Reed Sheppard is evaluated on what you think will happen and not on him being terrible for 5 months now.
Where is Bronny James 😂😂😂
aging like milk on a radiator.
"Bronny should have been a top 10 pick..He is destroying the g league, and he is about to be the face of the NBA."
Your estimation of Ron Holland is dead wrong. He is one of the very few defensive difference makers of this draft class. He´d certainly go top 10 in a Re-draft.
What’s the draft potential of fletcher loyer
Wow Kel’el Ware won rookie of the month and shot up the Rookie Of The Year race as soon as Spo gave him minutes. You did him dirty here.
Your Ron Holland take will age like milk.
Why the thumbnail guy in the Grizzlies jersey look like Sneako lmao
Good list but no Jaylen Wells who’s actually played better than Edey for the Grizzlies makes it lose so much credibility.
That bad grading on Kel’el Ware isn’t aging well lol
"Downvoting this nonsense. Overrated the fuck outta Knecht. 
Didnt do a full first rounder either..."
This aged terribly in just two months with Ware being the most impressive rookie with the highest upside.
Honestly what a forgettable year
Brook Lopez is a 3 pt sharp shooter
No yves missi equals no ball knowledge
Wells & Collier are easy top 10 picks if redrafted.  Collier's ceiling may be #1 just like it was going into USC
worst draft ever hands down
C for Sarr and B for Sheppard is hilarious
I was glad my spirit took castle it number four. And I wanted them to take Edie at number eight. But they traded it away for a 2031 first round pick. Which made no sense cause we need all the help we can get right now. Whenever the Spurs take Wemby out. Stats show that the team just fall apart.  Edi would’ve helped out the spurs tremendously. And since Wemby can move like a guard. He can play power forward sometimes when EDi is in the game at the same time he is.
You put Sarr too low in my opinion
This guy def doesn’t watch the wizards ☠️
how can you give alex sarr a C when everything you said about Risacher goes for him too??
Clingan is off to a good start. Bigs take time to develop and he is young. He will be a defensive force.
"as a pistons fan, i would definitely say you’re underrating holland. i’d agree he hasn’t been a top 5 caliber pick, but his defense is some of the best i’ve seen among most perimeter defenders this season, and ive watched 30+ games this season. he sometimes will guard the pg full court for a whole quarter or two in the 2nd/3rd, something i haven’t seen many players be able to do. also is insanely valuable as a cutter and hustle guy, just gets every loose ball and runs the floor too fast for anyone to catch. his shooting needs work but he’s been progressing"
"Kelel ware C 😂  rookie of the month , bad re draft"
"Reed Sheppard is in bust territory. He's literally been the worst player on the Rockets this season, and one of the worst rookies in general."
"To not have Jaylen Wells in the top 10 redraft made this whole video ridiculous 
Best Shooter 
2nd Best Defender
Starting for a top 5 team"
He cut it off at Tristan de Silva😢
Trippin Buzelis is Trash 🗑️
Salaun takes 6 minutes to get a shot off
"I'm sorry but you don't know ball. Sheppard and Salaun don't see the court because they're fucking ass, shooting like 30% from the field. Kelel Ware is really good and so does Jaylen Wells and Yves Missi you didn't even mention. Knecht is good but he ain't better than Sarr and Risacher."
I thought you were using Brook Lopez as an insult at first and was going to come in here blazing.
"Jared McCain is, in my opinion, the only player in this draft class that has shown the potential to make an All-NBA team in the future. If not for his injury he'd be the unanimous ROTY."
Yves Missi was leading in Rookie leader. And this guy doesn't even know Missi exists. That's when you know all these sports content creators are just idiots and saying craps
As an OKC fan we red shirted Topic this year so I wasn’t expecting much from our rookies but Ajay Mitchell has blown me away. He’s been outstanding for us coming off the bench. Can’t wait for Topic next season though. I think he’s going to push all these guys and be one of the top members of this class. Just imagine we actually win the title and get a lottery pick from next seasons loaded class and Topic who was basically a top 5 pick before he got hurt and we get another couple of firsts to go with them 🤯 the team is going to be bananas 🤦‍♂️
You should have mentioned Ryan Dunn.
Feel like you underrated the hell out of Kellel ware even with his small sample size
I like the prt where we dont see the highlight and just see this white flarg
jaylen wells the roty isnt even here
Ryan Dunn top ten
It hasn't even been long enough to call it terrible give it 3 years first
Knhecht gets a A grade? After shooting sub league average in 3p% and playing some of the worst defense a wing can play? What are you talking about?
"Sarr gets a C, but Dillingham gets a B? This is just based on your bias, not on what they've done on the court. Sarr is top 10 in blocks in the league and is 20 years old. That's worth a lot"
"It is too early... 
For Instance I comment one month later and Sarr has been 30/72 3pt for December and January and is now ranked as #1 on NBA rookie ladder (which by the way show this draft class is weak)... 
Wait for a year or two before reassessing the draft."
"Bro, Jaylen Wells play like a seasoned veteran in Memphis"
"As a wolves fan we’ve all been cheering for Rob to get more minutes, dude looks solid when he’s in the game."
Where Ryan Dunn at
am I dumb or did he completely pass over Yves Missi. As a pelicans fan I think he’s top 5 redraft
What mitchell is a top 10 rookie this year
"Like the research and most of all the grace that went into the vid man, nice to see some bigger content creators out there acknowledge how early it is for these prospects"
Jaylen Wells 1
Wtf is this 😂 no chance knecht is worth a lottery pick in this draft nevermind top 3
Gotta put Tristan Da Silva among that tog group of rookies now too
3 weeks later Alex Sarr is looking much better. That's why you don't make these videos before its even halfway through their rookie seasons lol
"Shotout for wearing the Orlando Playoffs Shirt man, that's fire🔥🔥"
No Jaylen wells mention?? He’s easily top 10 in the class
Alex Sarr is looking solid. Definitely deserves to go top #5 pick.
do other years!
LETS GO MAGIG!!!!!
Sarr is doing great how is he C grade?
Jaylen Wells makes it into top 10 for sure
Risacher's upside alone keeps him #1 overall. I think a lot of these guys in this class will be gone within 7 years. He will survive (injuries aside).
Since this vid was 3 weeks ago this isnt to bad me personally i have Yves Missi very high going at least top 7 in a redraft
Buzzi vert out of 10?? THATS BULLSHIT
Kelal ware draft grade is bad. Could be better id say. The developing him. Him not getting playing time should not make for a bad draft grade.
How has sarr become underrated tf
Not having jaylon wells in your top 10 redraft is criminal at this point
Yes keep up the good content !
Castle for MVP!
Wells and Missi??? No top 10?
Where the fuck is jaylen wells in tne redraft should be one
Just my player 16 and 17 picks have beef
"idk why people call this draft class so terrible, let’s see u play."
no jaylen wells?
Can u do the second round😊
absurd not to have yves missi in your top 10! good video otherwise
"When he likes the pick, he plays 
hi-lights in the background instead of their lowlights. Lol anyone else notice this?"
Ware could be amazing too if Miami wasn't morons
No love for Tristan Da Silva?  He’s been getting some solid minutes and contributing well
Is this part 1 or something
The fact you didn’t put Missi in this video makes it lose a lot of credibility.
Jaylen Wells is better than Knecht and McCain. The lockdown clinic he just gave Steph proves it.
No Jaylen wells this list is trash 🗑️
no MISSI ???? dude is ballin
Steph Castle is #1 for me too (although I’m French !)
"wearing a Magic shirt, I was just waiting for the report on Da Silva."
"Zach Edey is Brook Lopez at 9 overall?

Are we forgetting that Lopez was a multi time All Star?

I hope you’re saying Zach is going to be what Brook is NOW on the Bucks, not prime Brook Lopez."
Wells over knecht anyday of the week i would prefer consistency and wells is alot better of a defender
I was screaming from the roof tops that Sarr was terrible but no one wanted to listen 😭 seeing him play so many times in person being from Perth he looked so bad out there in our nbl what made anyone think he would be an nba ready player.
What a stupid video title.
my top 5 going into this draft was 1. Holland 2. Sarr 3. Castle 4. Knect 5. reed sheppard im pretty happy with that
Reed Sheppard is the only question mark that can be all star. The rockets don’t want to show case him . I have a feeling he will be good in the futurez
I would never draft Jared McCain 💅
"C'mon now, Ja'Kobe Walter is ballin out.  Don't be sleepin' on him."
"Dalton Knecht is a little high in the redraft, I'd put him behind Risacher and Edey, he's just a CONE defensivly"
U speed up your voice?
"As a blazers fan, Donovan clingon is going to be one of the best defenders the league will see. Most consecutive starting rookie season above Micheal Jordan and bill Russell"
But reed Shepherd is Houston's best player
The lottery is rigged by Silver and Bron could end up in prison and TV ratings are tanking.
"“He’s going to be a really good shooter for a long time,” as the player clanks two in a row."
Ajay Mitchell with the Thunder would go a lot higher in a redraft.
Do the regrade after the season is over. The season is far from being over
"Sorry lad, I stop watching at the A for Zach Edey. Probably there is a reason that very tall players don't play at NBA"
I have a hard time not putting Missi in the top-10. I’d put him in over Salaun.
this draft is gonna be LOADED with good role players
Jared McCain is not above castle
Matas gone be better than most of this class trust
"In a couple of months, the Raptors' Ja'Kobe Walter will prove he should have gone higher than #19. His offensive and defensive smarts are elite."
Atlanta Hawks biggest MISTAKE not DRAFT Bronny James Jr in 1st overall pick 😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅
Jaylen Brown BREAKDOWN you're next video Sporting Logically 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
Why most the highlights misses for reed and sarr
"hmm you heard the ""why isn't the american payer n°1"""
Embarrassing to leave out the rookie who’s leading the class in double-doubles…
"My team the Raptors have four rookies (one of which went undrafted) who are all getting signifigant minutes and making solid contributions, there may not have been the big names in this draft but there were plenty of guys who were NBA ready."
"No way you made a redraft and completely forgot last month's Rookie of the Month in Jaylen Wells...didn't even give any love for the Grizzlies drafting him at like #40

12 PPG hitting 38% of his threes as an early second rounder lol"
"It's obviously beyond the scope of this video, but Ajay Mitchell (pick #38) has proven to be a classic 2nd-round steal for OKC. A three-year player at an off-the-beaten-path program (UCSB), he's already become a solid rotation piece on one of the best and deepest squads in the Association. Probably doesn't have a super high ceiling, but who cares? He has an amazingly high floor for a second-round guy."
No love for Yves Missi? His emergence has been the one bright spot in a brutal season for the Pels
Dalton Knecht ROTY
"I don’t think this draft wasn’t that weak, it just want that known, especially if a lot more foreign guys coming in"
"I'm really happy with the Indiana Pacers R2, 35th pick Johnny Furphy, he's a really good 6'9 small foward that can shoot from the perimeter, and he can take it coast to coast for a casual dunk. Steal of the draft."
More of these homie. Very in depth 🔥
Looks like Zach has actaully lost weight since college.  That's odd.
I actually really like the brook Lopez comp
Stopping that high in the draft is some basic ass shit. Yves Missi was one of the biggest steals.
People laughed at the Sixers taking McCain over Knecht. Who's laughing now?? lol
"As a Hornets fan, youre spot on about Saluan. For a project player he looks a lot more polished and confident than I was expecting and Im excited to see him develop"
Bro aint been watching jakobe walter
"DID YOU SEE YVES MISSI PLAYNG BRO
WTF"
"I would not go that hard on Sarr considering the  ""leaders"" of your team are Poole and Kuzma. Doesn't exactly set you for success."
Ron Holland has played better than Reed Shepherd and it’s not even close
"Steph Castle is clearly 'the guy' of this draft class so far for me, with McCain being a close second. I would probably give Clingan the edge over Eden for the moment because he's younger and has looked more dominant defensively, but have been really impressed with Edey thus far. Jaylen Wells probably deserves to be in the conversation for lotto pick In a redraft at this point as well."
"Dalton Knecht is too high in your redraft. Has he looked as advertised and come in and immediately produced in his role? Yes. Is he almost 24 with a fairly projectable ceiling? Also yes. It's not unheard of for older players to take developmental leaps at later ages especially if they come into the league as older prospects, but the odds aren't great. Is it silly he went 17 on draft night? Probably, but it's far too soon to put him over some of the younger, rawer guys who went above him."
Hawks are pretty happy with Zaccharie. Great defense and cutting to be basket.
Mccain is a star
i will give you an INC grade for not doing the whole 1st round.
Knecht is  traffic cone on defense.
You need to move your image into a corner and not block the video.
ROY Stephon Castle.
Stephon Castle a super star in the making a robin to Wemby aka the alien GSG
Jared McCain ROTY also he's a YouTuber that right there makes you a #1 top guy in the 2024 draft. 🏀👏
Not sure how Jaylen Wells is not a top 10 pick. He literally guards the best player on the other team as a rookie and shoots lights out.
Totally agree about Reed. Wish he would’ve gone to a team that could give him minutes but it is what it is
Area 51 baby! Castle and Wemby have been so fun to watch together and that SA defense is looking stout. Supper excited for the rook we picked up
No love for Ryan Dunn? Bro is basically a more raw Mikal Bridges and has played some great minutes for the Suns.
Do you think Edey will actually become a rim protector on the level of Brook Lopez cause that is at least half of Brook’s value
scripted sport
Missi and Dunn? They have been really good enough to be on your top 10. I completely agree with your top 5.
I don't trust 76ers point guard hype bc what they said from out of there own mouth with Michael Carter Williams
"Jared McCain, Zach Edey, Stephon Castle, and Zaccharie Risacher have been doing amazing for their teams so far"
Yves Missi is definitely a top 10 redraft
"You must have had your MAGA glasses on when you did this review… all the white guys seem to get a better than expected rating from you… what a surprise from a caucasian analyst!   And that is sad because the white  guys that are really good, like the center on Menphis, are going to be hurt  by your serious worship of the guard in Houston that has been nothing but a bust!   Yet… There are enough great white players on their own merit, although european, that are as good as any players in the NBA that when white guys like you heap unworthy praise on undeserving white players, it hurts your cause.  Yeah, i know you don’t have a cause…. Just keep helping  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"
"Pistons fan here, Ron Holland can't shoot but he affects the game in just about every other way. His defense is great, he gets out in transition, he's a connector on offense and solid slasher. His impact doesn't always show up on the stat sheet. There's not any other perimeter players outside of McCain and maybe Knecht that I'd rather have out of this draft so far, but long term I think Ron's upside is way higher."
No mention of Bronny James?
McCain and Knecht are overrated bc they got good spots on top heavy teams.
Hello where is Wells
Ryan Dunn snubbed
"I you’re a tad bit tough on Sarr. Look he is a BAD offensive player right now. No doubt. But Alexandre has CRAZY transition potential, and has shown a lot of playmaking chops in the open court. 

I feel like he is a lot more flexible in his than Bamba was. Bamba was a straight center. I think Sarr was some “wingy” aspects that could make him be a little more versatile that what you’re saying. I think he’ll be a great player for a long time. Especially when he gets competent players around him."
Ja'Kobe Walter looking like he should have been a top 5 pick
Dalton Knecht could go 2 or 3? No he couldn't. What a horrible take man. Not a god damn chance.
"As a lakers fan Knecht 3rd is crazy. I think late lottery for him, he’s a grown man"
"I think you should put the brakes on the value of weak defenders. In the end they add less value than a good efficient role player. Look at the best teams. They are good because they don’t have terrible defenders in vital roles. I know it’s a bit early here but the most valuable players in this draft are the ones with 2 way potential like Castle, Risacher and Sheppard. Behind them are the defenders that can develop shots like Dunn in Phoenix, Salon, Holland and Da Silva. My pick for ROY is Devin Carter but I’m not sure how serious his injury was."
What matters: Lean on Jesus! Jesus loves you and knows you by name! Christ Jesus is knocking at your door! Let Him in! Jesus has saved me!! ✝❤🙏💪
Area 51 babyyy
Do it for other draft classes please
that Ryan Dunn for Phoenix looks like a top 10 draft player
"Of the top 20 draftees 15 are only 19 or 20 years old, and 5 are 22-23. A 19-20 years old prospect can evolve in many directions, and it is too early to evaluate them after 2 months, moreover overseas players have to adapt to a new country. Knecht looks good but is is probably much closer to his ceiling than the youngsters. Most teams bid on the future when drafting very young kids."
"i love you Tucker, but the disrespect to draft alex sarr over Ryan Dunn is actually criminal."
"Still way to early to grade these guys but I saw a lot of Castle is a bust, what a reach, he has been damn good"
This class is still very weak it’s actually going exactly like they said not any SUPERSTAR/All Star players but I do see a lot of good Starters maybe fringe level all stars.
"This guy needs to watch Missi's highlights against the Spurs. Steal...coast to coast...eurostep slam @ 6'-11"" come on now ....show me a better rookie highlight"
"you need to go back and watch the next pick Tristian Da Silva, he should be in your top 10"
I almost completely agree with your top 5 I would maybe just swap edey and risacher
Its barely been a season for fucks sake i hate casuals
"For Risacher, as a Hawks fan, the big thing for me was how good his defense has been. He is so skinny but he uses his length and quickness and lateral movement to be an above average defender so far"
Give the Kings a F... Monte McNair taking Carter was a terrible pick and Carter better be amazing to justify to stupidity of the pick.
Please do this for other draft classes
Just cause McCain and dalton have played by far the best doesn’t mean they’re by far the best prospects. No shot they go 1 and 2 in a redraft lol Sarr prolly still goes one ily but what is this reactionary ass video lmao
Jared McCain for ROTY
The thing about Castle is his dogged defense alone earns him a starting 5 slot. Add to that his developing offense and playmaking and this kid is a surefire future All Star.
My biggest flex in life was always saying people were underrating this class. No idea why it was talked up to be one of the worst of all time.
I didnt even watch I just disliked the video
Castle best player in draft.
"I think this draft has been better than expected and I’m a huge fan of McCain and Castle so far. I think Risacher, Missi, and Bub have all shown a lot as well. I personally think Knecht and Edey have been way overrated, as older prospects always seem to be when they come out swinging early in their career (think Jaquez of last year). I would put Clingan way higher in redraft"
Wearing a Magic shirt but stopping at 17 right before the Magics pick is disgusting. Take off that shirt you phony
Tokyo’s video is 2 years too early
"As a Charlotte Hornets fan, I’m really happy with our #6 pick Tidjane Salaun! A 6’10 wing that can shoot from 3 and plays with high energy. Youngest player in draft and he was playing great before his ankle sprain."
"Love the grades, I do think people always overvalue Knecht. Dude practically, has a worse statline than castle barring, the efficiency. You have to understand that this is Stephon Castle's floor and Dalton Knecht's ceiling, he will not be better than this other than a good Duncan Robinson season.

Stephon Castle is a legit star #2 of either a Jimmy Butler or Jrue Holiday. Potentially better than both of those. If I was betting Risacher and McCain are the only ones that may or may not be better in the long run."
Ajay Mitchell easily goes top 10 in a redraft
No Dunn?
"Regarding Risacher, I really think that (and not just because he is also French) he reminds me of a young Nic Batum.  I do think that Risacher is much more advanced than Batum was 15 yrs ago, and he also has good handles which Batum never was very strong at...  So I predict that he will be a 15pct better Batum in about two years."
Yves Missi not listed???
Castle is big win for spurs..he is all around..he can lock curry .. all defensive team
lmao how do you not even mention Yves Missi casual ass
"Castle, Missi and McCain are the top 3 ROTY for this season💯💪😊👍"
Ya gotta pray Zach Edey develops a shot like brook Lopez look at yourself in the mirror he’s never gonna be close to wemby
Spurs gonna be unstoppable
Dalton Knecht is 23 years old... It is just not worth it to compare him to a 19 years old prospect.
"I'm happy I'm not the only one really high on the Hornets' pick. Yeah, he has the potential to not be super impactful, but a big criticism I always had with the Hornets before Jordan reduced his ownership role was not taking bigger swings on picks and always going for the overly safe option with middle of the lottery selections while still getting burned on it anyway. This new regime saw a guy that could turn out to be a solid swing in the top 10 of a bad draft and figured it was worth the gamble. Still a lot of projecting with him like you mentioned, but I'm happy they at least took a chance on a guy that could have some upside in a weak draft. I've also liked what I've seen from him so far too, so this new regime is doing well for me so far."
"Feeling pretty good about the Steph Castle selection. Conversely, starting to get a little worried Atlanta is gonna make those Dejounte picks kinda meh. ZR isn’t the typical
#1 pick but he’s still helping. (Yeah yeah, we got Wemby I shouldn’t complain about shit!)"
"Sheppard grading above Sarr is ludicrous.  Sarr's grade I get but Sheppard has been miserable so far, Houston is getting almost nothing from him."
"Nah Sarr gets wayyyy too much hate, he averages 2 blocks a game a rookie? Hes shown flashed of shooting and being a lob threat? As far as rookies go he’s literally been one of the best your absolutely trippin bro"
Saying Castle could go as high as 2 was laughable considering he's an inefficient shot jacker He's not a great shooter and sure he might get you 12 to 15 points but he's going to need 12 to 15 shots to get those points.
I totally agree with the Edey take.  IMO big win for the Grizz at 9th.  Dont sleep on Jaylen Wells....dude is a baller.  He is taking on the best offensive player on the other team every night for the team in the Western Conference with the 2nd best record.  As a rookie...definitely good stuff.
This class is like the 2011 draft class hidden jewelry.
Yessir steph castle is him
Those Top picks French players are Terrible
Alex sarr shooting too much threes
"I don’t understand your logic behind McCain number 1 in the redraft. You clearly laid out the reason Atlanta chose Zacc but then went against that by having them take Jared number one. McCain doesn’t fit what Atlanta is trying to do defensively. Yes, he’s out producing Zacc statistically so far, but it’s team identity you probably should be looking at?! 

Also, side note…. So many 🏀 YouTubers are going crazy on picks 16/17… I’ve been watching basketball a long time… I can remember a lot of people back in ‘09 saying “Brandon Jennings is the greatest thing since sliced bread…” hahaha let’s let not get ahead of ourselves. 

All of this to say - Atlanta wouldn’t choose McCain #1 in a redraft lol"
Idiot that boy from spurs is the real deal...that  one from phily is a pretender
Missi and Wells have got to be in the top 5 bruh.....
So were just not gonna talk about yves missi?
So were just not gonna talk about yves missi?
No mention of Yves Missi at 21?
"I ended up dropping Edy for Mccain in my leauge, super happy with that"
"Thank you for respecting Steph Castle. He has been hooping for my spurs, and the future is bright with him and wemby"
"That right KNECHT 4 doNT play games with him he is the game lol 37pts for a rookie, LAKERS NATION"
Does Washington regret not having taken Edey at #2 yet?
The only thing terrible related to this year’s draft were the takes before the event and during Summer League.
Really good draft. “Experts” and the casuals like this tool will be proven wrong
"As a Grizzlies fan getting Zach Edey, Jaylen Wells, GG Jackson, Walker Kessler (Traded), Santi Aldama, Vince Williams, Trey Murphy (Traded), and Desmond Bane over the last 4 years is insane in the drafts including 2nd rounders is insane! They never miss on picks."
My bro did Yves Missi dirty
I think Sarr goes like 8 in a redraft
"Dalton knecht would def not got top 2 in a redraft many teams knew he could play but how much growth does he have is still a question he’s 23 years old. Teams would still take the upside of a castle, reed, or cuz from Atlanta over a 23 year old rookie who looks good but also still projects to be a role player"
Stephon 🏰🏰🏰>>>>> your favorite rookie 😈
Knecht has sucked three games in a row.   The league may have him figured out
Your “re-draft” at the end seems to just be just a top-10 that doesn’t take into account each team’s needs
"Honorable mentions: Jaylen Wells, Yves Missi, and Tristan DeSilva."
Risacher to this point has been a great role player for the hawks. Shooting has been off but he has been a great defender for a rookie and is a + defender for most teams. He is a reason why Atlanta has had a resurgence defensively despite Trae Young not shooting the ball well and Atlanta as a whole struggling to shoot from 3.
"On top of Jaylen Wells, can’t forget Jamal Shead who is a dawg defensively and was leading the class in assists per game and still Top 3 in that category presently. Mogbo also from the Raptors is doing a little bit of everything in terms of playmaking, rebounding, and is a stud defensively. He’s slowly developing as a scorer too. Those 3 right now over Sarr, Salaun and Dillingham"
You create a redraft that doesn't include YVES MISSI wow!That is wild...Yves could small all this guys and he is having already 6 DOUBLE DOUBLES ahead of all other players by far
it has been 2 months lol
He stopped right before Tristan Da Silva 😢
Yves Missi???
Steph Castle for ROTY
It's too early. Mike Conley was a bust his 1st 4-5 years
Clingan is better than Kessler. Already a functional jumper and his lateral movement is already elite. The way he deflects slashers and steps up in Drop reminds me of Marcus Camby. Think he’s Top 5 in the class easily.
Awesome video. Can you put the original draft number beside the re-draft. Make more of these. Love it.
Super bready redraft 🍞
"I said it probably would turn out better than we all thought, I was right"
Steph Castle is a joy to watch.
Mccain and Knecht some MP Shep Owens type shii
STEPH CASTLE FOR ROTY!!!
"You can't fault anyone who was drafted by the Wizards until they've been away from the franchise for at least twice the time they were with the Wizards and, of course, once they've gone through a complete year of therapy from the American Trauma Victims Association or other evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy group."
Wells????
I am a sad hornets fan. If you get the opportunity to watch the hornets and tidjan play he genuinely makes it worth the watch. He plays like he's just happy to be there and he brings me joy with how much joy he plays with
ZR looks way less of project I thought he would be as a hawks fan offensive numbers don’t jump at you but his length and defensive ability has led to Deandre hunter having his most consistent season offensively so far off the bench. Good vid man.
You forgot about the ROTY Jaylen Wells. He would go at least top 4.
"ngl im trying not to hate but half of your picks basically some up to i just really like this guy .and does not even look into impact or stats whatsoever . the fact you didn't even have jaylen wells in your top 3 is crazy or tristan da silva but named dillingham and reed shepheard who don't even play is crazy
1. jared mcain
2. jaylen wells 
3.zach edey 
4. castle 
5. knecht"
Jaylen Wells?
No Ajay Mitchell? Smh
As a Spurs fan I'm liking this class pretty well since it got us Castle. He has his ups and downs being a rookie but overall he looks like he's gonna really work out. Just kind of wishing the team would have taken Knecht at #8 now too.
your grade and redraft for yves missi?
good analysis.. agree 100%
You can say McCain has been better so far but I’d easily take Castle 1 in a redraft.
Bruh did you not remember Jaylen Wells??
Do the 2021 draft
Yves
"W Tidjane love, he’s a future superstar 🐝"
What would you give Ja'Kobe Walter?
"I just want Donovan Clingan to be healthy. He was a defensive force in the games he’s started for us. 

Also I don’t know why Castle hasn’t gotten much hype. He’s looked good in the games I’ve seen him play."
Jaylen Wells  at 5 or 6
"Alex Sarr is still a teenager and the Wizards knew he was a project player. Give him time, and we will see. He could be a bust or become a very solid player"
Dalton def number 1
Re-grading after not even halfway through their rookie season 💀 not taking this shit serious at all lmao
"highkey 3/4 of this video is just ""we haven't seen enough of this guy, so here's my personal opinion"" :/"
Yves Missi
Nice shirt!!! 🔥🔥🔥
"JAYLEN WELLS? He was ROOKIE OF THE MONTH for November, starting on the #2 team in the West averaging almost 12ppg with 45/39/80 shooting splits, while always defending the other teams best guy. Come on do some research."
Please do more draft ratings
"Finally, a person that gives Stephon Castle the respect he deserves. You know ball."
Yuki!
Jaylen Wells too underrated... 12ppg starter and great defender on 2nd best team (by record*) in the west
No love for Yves Missi??
"I’m honestly really high on risacher I think he’s really good and will have a strong career, for a weak class the hawks did as well as they could"
Pelle Larsson
Too early for this especially for a class like this

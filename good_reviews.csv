"Where would you put Hukportie that went to the Knicks. He’s been much better than expected. Once he figures out how to stop fouling so much he can be a defensive beast. 
Zach eddy has the same foul trouble issues as well though.",4
"Umm…yes, I’m a Wolves homer, but I can honestly say that Rob Dillingham is a breath of fresh air and I wouldn’t re-pick anyone else in this draft. He’s quick and flashy, exciting to watch. He’s still too skinny and his defense needs work, but this guy has the potential to be a star in this league. One thing is for sure: Dilly is NO bust. Coach Finch just needs to play Dilly more, and that’s on Finch—not on Dillingham. 

If Dilly were in a faster, run ‘n’ gun offense of, say, Don Nelson’s, Rob would be a 20-22 ppg / 7-8 asst guy every night. When Mike Conley finally retires at the end of the season, you’ll see a big change in how the Wolves operate as Dilly will get all those minutes…and he’ll bloom right before our eyes. It’s coming. Don’t miss it!

Also, Terrence Shannon Jr. is a stud, and he’s gonna be a 20 ppg / 7-8 rebounds per game guy, too. If you add him to this re-draft list, he’d be in the top 10, too…likely top 7. Again, it’s Coach Finch holding him back. Get the man more playing time, and we’ll see…just like we saw the other night as the Wolves came back from 25 down to beat the Thunder in OT. That wasn’t a fluke, folks. TJ is relentless on offense. He doesn’t stop.

The sky is the limit for these two young guys on the Wolves. Add in 2nd year man Jaylen Clark’s defense and the Ant Man…woah.",4
liked and subbed cuz of the magic shirt,5
devious work with the highlight package to shoe in your narrative,5
Dalton Knect should've been 1 or 2,3
Where is Bronny James 😂😂😂,5
aging like milk on a radiator.,4
What’s the draft potential of fletcher loyer,4
Wow Kel’el Ware won rookie of the month and shot up the Rookie Of The Year race as soon as Spo gave him minutes. You did him dirty here.,5
Your Ron Holland take will age like milk.,5
Good list but no Jaylen Wells who’s actually played better than Edey for the Grizzlies makes it lose so much credibility.,3
Brook Lopez is a 3 pt sharp shooter,4
Wells & Collier are easy top 10 picks if redrafted.  Collier's ceiling may be #1 just like it was going into USC,4
C for Sarr and B for Sheppard is hilarious,5
Clingan is off to a good start. Bigs take time to develop and he is young. He will be a defensive force.,4
"as a pistons fan, i would definitely say you’re underrating holland. i’d agree he hasn’t been a top 5 caliber pick, but his defense is some of the best i’ve seen among most perimeter defenders this season, and ive watched 30+ games this season. he sometimes will guard the pg full court for a whole quarter or two in the 2nd/3rd, something i haven’t seen many players be able to do. also is insanely valuable as a cutter and hustle guy, just gets every loose ball and runs the floor too fast for anyone to catch. his shooting needs work but he’s been progressing",4
"Kelel ware C 😂  rookie of the month , bad re draft",5
He cut it off at Tristan de Silva😢,3
"I'm sorry but you don't know ball. Sheppard and Salaun don't see the court because they're fucking ass, shooting like 30% from the field. Kelel Ware is really good and so does Jaylen Wells and Yves Missi you didn't even mention. Knecht is good but he ain't better than Sarr and Risacher.",3
"Jared McCain is, in my opinion, the only player in this draft class that has shown the potential to make an All-NBA team in the future. If not for his injury he'd be the unanimous ROTY.",4
As an OKC fan we red shirted Topic this year so I wasn’t expecting much from our rookies but Ajay Mitchell has blown me away. He’s been outstanding for us coming off the bench. Can’t wait for Topic next season though. I think he’s going to push all these guys and be one of the top members of this class. Just imagine we actually win the title and get a lottery pick from next seasons loaded class and Topic who was basically a top 5 pick before he got hurt and we get another couple of firsts to go with them 🤯 the team is going to be bananas 🤦‍♂️,4
You should have mentioned Ryan Dunn.,3
Feel like you underrated the hell out of Kellel ware even with his small sample size,5
I like the prt where we dont see the highlight and just see this white flarg,4
Ryan Dunn top ten,5
"Sarr gets a C, but Dillingham gets a B? This is just based on your bias, not on what they've done on the court. Sarr is top 10 in blocks in the league and is 20 years old. That's worth a lot",3
"Bro, Jaylen Wells play like a seasoned veteran in Memphis",5
"As a wolves fan we’ve all been cheering for Rob to get more minutes, dude looks solid when he’s in the game.",4
Where Ryan Dunn at,4
What mitchell is a top 10 rookie this year,5
"Like the research and most of all the grace that went into the vid man, nice to see some bigger content creators out there acknowledge how early it is for these prospects",4
Jaylen Wells 1,5
Wtf is this 😂 no chance knecht is worth a lottery pick in this draft nevermind top 3,5
Gotta put Tristan Da Silva among that tog group of rookies now too,5
"Shotout for wearing the Orlando Playoffs Shirt man, that's fire🔥🔥",4
No Jaylen wells mention?? He’s easily top 10 in the class,5
Alex Sarr is looking solid. Definitely deserves to go top #5 pick.,5
do other years!,5
LETS GO MAGIG!!!!!,5
Sarr is doing great how is he C grade?,5
Jaylen Wells makes it into top 10 for sure,5
Risacher's upside alone keeps him #1 overall. I think a lot of these guys in this class will be gone within 7 years. He will survive (injuries aside).,5
How has sarr become underrated tf,5
Yes keep up the good content !,5
Castle for MVP!,5
Just my player 16 and 17 picks have beef,5
Can u do the second round😊,3
Ware could be amazing too if Miami wasn't morons,3
No love for Tristan Da Silva?  He’s been getting some solid minutes and contributing well,4
Is this part 1 or something,3
Jaylen Wells is better than Knecht and McCain. The lockdown clinic he just gave Steph proves it.,4
Steph Castle is #1 for me too (although I’m French !),5
"wearing a Magic shirt, I was just waiting for the report on Da Silva.",3
"Zach Edey is Brook Lopez at 9 overall?

Are we forgetting that Lopez was a multi time All Star?

I hope you’re saying Zach is going to be what Brook is NOW on the Bucks, not prime Brook Lopez.",3
my top 5 going into this draft was 1. Holland 2. Sarr 3. Castle 4. Knect 5. reed sheppard im pretty happy with that,5
Reed Sheppard is the only question mark that can be all star. The rockets don’t want to show case him . I have a feeling he will be good in the futurez,4
"Dalton Knecht is a little high in the redraft, I'd put him behind Risacher and Edey, he's just a CONE defensivly",3
"As a blazers fan, Donovan clingon is going to be one of the best defenders the league will see. Most consecutive starting rookie season above Micheal Jordan and bill Russell",5
But reed Shepherd is Houston's best player,4
"“He’s going to be a really good shooter for a long time,” as the player clanks two in a row.",4
Ajay Mitchell with the Thunder would go a lot higher in a redraft.,3
this draft is gonna be LOADED with good role players,5
Matas gone be better than most of this class trust,5
"In a couple of months, the Raptors' Ja'Kobe Walter will prove he should have gone higher than #19. His offensive and defensive smarts are elite.",4
Jaylen Brown BREAKDOWN you're next video Sporting Logically 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤😤,5
"My team the Raptors have four rookies (one of which went undrafted) who are all getting signifigant minutes and making solid contributions, there may not have been the big names in this draft but there were plenty of guys who were NBA ready.",4
"It's obviously beyond the scope of this video, but Ajay Mitchell (pick #38) has proven to be a classic 2nd-round steal for OKC. A three-year player at an off-the-beaten-path program (UCSB), he's already become a solid rotation piece on one of the best and deepest squads in the Association. Probably doesn't have a super high ceiling, but who cares? He has an amazingly high floor for a second-round guy.",3
No love for Yves Missi? His emergence has been the one bright spot in a brutal season for the Pels,5
Dalton Knecht ROTY,5
"I don’t think this draft wasn’t that weak, it just want that known, especially if a lot more foreign guys coming in",3
"I'm really happy with the Indiana Pacers R2, 35th pick Johnny Furphy, he's a really good 6'9 small foward that can shoot from the perimeter, and he can take it coast to coast for a casual dunk. Steal of the draft.",5
More of these homie. Very in depth 🔥,5
Looks like Zach has actaully lost weight since college.  That's odd.,3
I actually really like the brook Lopez comp,4
"As a Hornets fan, youre spot on about Saluan. For a project player he looks a lot more polished and confident than I was expecting and Im excited to see him develop",4
Bro aint been watching jakobe walter,3
Ron Holland has played better than Reed Shepherd and it’s not even close,3
"Steph Castle is clearly 'the guy' of this draft class so far for me, with McCain being a close second. I would probably give Clingan the edge over Eden for the moment because he's younger and has looked more dominant defensively, but have been really impressed with Edey thus far. Jaylen Wells probably deserves to be in the conversation for lotto pick In a redraft at this point as well.",4
"Dalton Knecht is too high in your redraft. Has he looked as advertised and come in and immediately produced in his role? Yes. Is he almost 24 with a fairly projectable ceiling? Also yes. It's not unheard of for older players to take developmental leaps at later ages especially if they come into the league as older prospects, but the odds aren't great. Is it silly he went 17 on draft night? Probably, but it's far too soon to put him over some of the younger, rawer guys who went above him.",3
Hawks are pretty happy with Zaccharie. Great defense and cutting to be basket.,5
Mccain is a star,5
ROY Stephon Castle.,5
Stephon Castle a super star in the making a robin to Wemby aka the alien GSG,5
Area 51 baby! Castle and Wemby have been so fun to watch together and that SA defense is looking stout. Supper excited for the rook we picked up,5
No love for Ryan Dunn? Bro is basically a more raw Mikal Bridges and has played some great minutes for the Suns.,3
scripted sport,4
Missi and Dunn? They have been really good enough to be on your top 10. I completely agree with your top 5.,5
"Jared McCain, Zach Edey, Stephon Castle, and Zaccharie Risacher have been doing amazing for their teams so far",5
Yves Missi is definitely a top 10 redraft,5
"You must have had your MAGA glasses on when you did this review… all the white guys seem to get a better than expected rating from you… what a surprise from a caucasian analyst!   And that is sad because the white  guys that are really good, like the center on Menphis, are going to be hurt  by your serious worship of the guard in Houston that has been nothing but a bust!   Yet… There are enough great white players on their own merit, although european, that are as good as any players in the NBA that when white guys like you heap unworthy praise on undeserving white players, it hurts your cause.  Yeah, i know you don’t have a cause…. Just keep helping  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!",5
"Pistons fan here, Ron Holland can't shoot but he affects the game in just about every other way. His defense is great, he gets out in transition, he's a connector on offense and solid slasher. His impact doesn't always show up on the stat sheet. There's not any other perimeter players outside of McCain and maybe Knecht that I'd rather have out of this draft so far, but long term I think Ron's upside is way higher.",4
"I you’re a tad bit tough on Sarr. Look he is a BAD offensive player right now. No doubt. But Alexandre has CRAZY transition potential, and has shown a lot of playmaking chops in the open court. 

I feel like he is a lot more flexible in his than Bamba was. Bamba was a straight center. I think Sarr was some “wingy” aspects that could make him be a little more versatile that what you’re saying. I think he’ll be a great player for a long time. Especially when he gets competent players around him.",4
Ja'Kobe Walter looking like he should have been a top 5 pick,3
"As a lakers fan Knecht 3rd is crazy. I think late lottery for him, he’s a grown man",5
"I think you should put the brakes on the value of weak defenders. In the end they add less value than a good efficient role player. Look at the best teams. They are good because they don’t have terrible defenders in vital roles. I know it’s a bit early here but the most valuable players in this draft are the ones with 2 way potential like Castle, Risacher and Sheppard. Behind them are the defenders that can develop shots like Dunn in Phoenix, Salon, Holland and Da Silva. My pick for ROY is Devin Carter but I’m not sure how serious his injury was.",3
What matters: Lean on Jesus! Jesus loves you and knows you by name! Christ Jesus is knocking at your door! Let Him in! Jesus has saved me!! ✝❤🙏💪,5
Area 51 babyyy,4
Do it for other draft classes please,3
that Ryan Dunn for Phoenix looks like a top 10 draft player,5
"Of the top 20 draftees 15 are only 19 or 20 years old, and 5 are 22-23. A 19-20 years old prospect can evolve in many directions, and it is too early to evaluate them after 2 months, moreover overseas players have to adapt to a new country. Knecht looks good but is is probably much closer to his ceiling than the youngsters. Most teams bid on the future when drafting very young kids.",3
"i love you Tucker, but the disrespect to draft alex sarr over Ryan Dunn is actually criminal.",3
"Still way to early to grade these guys but I saw a lot of Castle is a bust, what a reach, he has been damn good",3
"you need to go back and watch the next pick Tristian Da Silva, he should be in your top 10",5
I almost completely agree with your top 5 I would maybe just swap edey and risacher,5
"For Risacher, as a Hawks fan, the big thing for me was how good his defense has been. He is so skinny but he uses his length and quickness and lateral movement to be an above average defender so far",4
Please do this for other draft classes,3
Jared McCain for ROTY,3
The thing about Castle is his dogged defense alone earns him a starting 5 slot. Add to that his developing offense and playmaking and this kid is a surefire future All Star.,4
Castle best player in draft.,5
"I think this draft has been better than expected and I’m a huge fan of McCain and Castle so far. I think Risacher, Missi, and Bub have all shown a lot as well. I personally think Knecht and Edey have been way overrated, as older prospects always seem to be when they come out swinging early in their career (think Jaquez of last year). I would put Clingan way higher in redraft",4
"As a Charlotte Hornets fan, I’m really happy with our #6 pick Tidjane Salaun! A 6’10 wing that can shoot from 3 and plays with high energy. Youngest player in draft and he was playing great before his ankle sprain.",5
"Love the grades, I do think people always overvalue Knecht. Dude practically, has a worse statline than castle barring, the efficiency. You have to understand that this is Stephon Castle's floor and Dalton Knecht's ceiling, he will not be better than this other than a good Duncan Robinson season.

Stephon Castle is a legit star #2 of either a Jimmy Butler or Jrue Holiday. Potentially better than both of those. If I was betting Risacher and McCain are the only ones that may or may not be better in the long run.",4
Ajay Mitchell easily goes top 10 in a redraft,5
No Dunn?,3
"Regarding Risacher, I really think that (and not just because he is also French) he reminds me of a young Nic Batum.  I do think that Risacher is much more advanced than Batum was 15 yrs ago, and he also has good handles which Batum never was very strong at...  So I predict that he will be a 15pct better Batum in about two years.",3
Castle is big win for spurs..he is all around..he can lock curry .. all defensive team,5
lmao how do you not even mention Yves Missi casual ass,5
"Castle, Missi and McCain are the top 3 ROTY for this season💯💪😊👍",5
"I'm happy I'm not the only one really high on the Hornets' pick. Yeah, he has the potential to not be super impactful, but a big criticism I always had with the Hornets before Jordan reduced his ownership role was not taking bigger swings on picks and always going for the overly safe option with middle of the lottery selections while still getting burned on it anyway. This new regime saw a guy that could turn out to be a solid swing in the top 10 of a bad draft and figured it was worth the gamble. Still a lot of projecting with him like you mentioned, but I'm happy they at least took a chance on a guy that could have some upside in a weak draft. I've also liked what I've seen from him so far too, so this new regime is doing well for me so far.",4
"Feeling pretty good about the Steph Castle selection. Conversely, starting to get a little worried Atlanta is gonna make those Dejounte picks kinda meh. ZR isn’t the typical
#1 pick but he’s still helping. (Yeah yeah, we got Wemby I shouldn’t complain about shit!)",3
I totally agree with the Edey take.  IMO big win for the Grizz at 9th.  Dont sleep on Jaylen Wells....dude is a baller.  He is taking on the best offensive player on the other team every night for the team in the Western Conference with the 2nd best record.  As a rookie...definitely good stuff.,5
This class is like the 2011 draft class hidden jewelry.,5
Yessir steph castle is him,5
Missi and Wells have got to be in the top 5 bruh.....,5
So were just not gonna talk about yves missi?,3
So were just not gonna talk about yves missi?,3
"I ended up dropping Edy for Mccain in my leauge, super happy with that",5
"Thank you for respecting Steph Castle. He has been hooping for my spurs, and the future is bright with him and wemby",5
Really good draft. “Experts” and the casuals like this tool will be proven wrong,4
I think Sarr goes like 8 in a redraft,3
"Dalton knecht would def not got top 2 in a redraft many teams knew he could play but how much growth does he have is still a question he’s 23 years old. Teams would still take the upside of a castle, reed, or cuz from Atlanta over a 23 year old rookie who looks good but also still projects to be a role player",3
Stephon 🏰🏰🏰>>>>> your favorite rookie 😈,5
Your “re-draft” at the end seems to just be just a top-10 that doesn’t take into account each team’s needs,3
"Honorable mentions: Jaylen Wells, Yves Missi, and Tristan DeSilva.",4
Risacher to this point has been a great role player for the hawks. Shooting has been off but he has been a great defender for a rookie and is a + defender for most teams. He is a reason why Atlanta has had a resurgence defensively despite Trae Young not shooting the ball well and Atlanta as a whole struggling to shoot from 3.,3
"On top of Jaylen Wells, can’t forget Jamal Shead who is a dawg defensively and was leading the class in assists per game and still Top 3 in that category presently. Mogbo also from the Raptors is doing a little bit of everything in terms of playmaking, rebounding, and is a stud defensively. He’s slowly developing as a scorer too. Those 3 right now over Sarr, Salaun and Dillingham",5
Steph Castle for ROTY,4
Clingan is better than Kessler. Already a functional jumper and his lateral movement is already elite. The way he deflects slashers and steps up in Drop reminds me of Marcus Camby. Think he’s Top 5 in the class easily.,5
Awesome video. Can you put the original draft number beside the re-draft. Make more of these. Love it.,5
Super bready redraft 🍞,5
"I said it probably would turn out better than we all thought, I was right",3
Steph Castle is a joy to watch.,5
Mccain and Knecht some MP Shep Owens type shii,3
STEPH CASTLE FOR ROTY!!!,5
I am a sad hornets fan. If you get the opportunity to watch the hornets and tidjan play he genuinely makes it worth the watch. He plays like he's just happy to be there and he brings me joy with how much joy he plays with,5
ZR looks way less of project I thought he would be as a hawks fan offensive numbers don’t jump at you but his length and defensive ability has led to Deandre hunter having his most consistent season offensively so far off the bench. Good vid man.,3
You forgot about the ROTY Jaylen Wells. He would go at least top 4.,3
"ngl im trying not to hate but half of your picks basically some up to i just really like this guy .and does not even look into impact or stats whatsoever . the fact you didn't even have jaylen wells in your top 3 is crazy or tristan da silva but named dillingham and reed shepheard who don't even play is crazy
1. jared mcain
2. jaylen wells 
3.zach edey 
4. castle 
5. knecht",4
As a Spurs fan I'm liking this class pretty well since it got us Castle. He has his ups and downs being a rookie but overall he looks like he's gonna really work out. Just kind of wishing the team would have taken Knecht at #8 now too.,4
your grade and redraft for yves missi?,3
good analysis.. agree 100%,5
You can say McCain has been better so far but I’d easily take Castle 1 in a redraft.,3
Do the 2021 draft,5
Yves,5
"W Tidjane love, he’s a future superstar 🐝",5
What would you give Ja'Kobe Walter?,5
"I just want Donovan Clingan to be healthy. He was a defensive force in the games he’s started for us. 

Also I don’t know why Castle hasn’t gotten much hype. He’s looked good in the games I’ve seen him play.",4
Jaylen Wells  at 5 or 6,3
"Alex Sarr is still a teenager and the Wizards knew he was a project player. Give him time, and we will see. He could be a bust or become a very solid player",4
"highkey 3/4 of this video is just ""we haven't seen enough of this guy, so here's my personal opinion"" :/",3
Yves Missi,4
Nice shirt!!! 🔥🔥🔥,5
"JAYLEN WELLS? He was ROOKIE OF THE MONTH for November, starting on the #2 team in the West averaging almost 12ppg with 45/39/80 shooting splits, while always defending the other teams best guy. Come on do some research.",3
Please do more draft ratings,3
"Finally, a person that gives Stephon Castle the respect he deserves. You know ball.",5
Yuki!,5
Jaylen Wells too underrated... 12ppg starter and great defender on 2nd best team (by record*) in the west,5
"I’m honestly really high on risacher I think he’s really good and will have a strong career, for a weak class the hawks did as well as they could",4
Pelle Larsson,5

tiktok dancer outplaying pandemic p bruh,1
I don't get some of these. How is it a regrade is Reed Sheppard is evaluated on what you think will happen and not on him being terrible for 5 months now.,1
"Bronny should have been a top 10 pick..He is destroying the g league, and he is about to be the face of the NBA.",2
Your estimation of Ron Holland is dead wrong. He is one of the very few defensive difference makers of this draft class. He´d certainly go top 10 in a Re-draft.,1
Why the thumbnail guy in the Grizzlies jersey look like Sneako lmao,1
That bad grading on Kel’el Ware isn’t aging well lol,1
"Downvoting this nonsense. Overrated the fuck outta Knecht. 
Didnt do a full first rounder either...",1
This aged terribly in just two months with Ware being the most impressive rookie with the highest upside.,1
Honestly what a forgettable year,1
No yves missi equals no ball knowledge,1
worst draft ever hands down,1
I was glad my spirit took castle it number four. And I wanted them to take Edie at number eight. But they traded it away for a 2031 first round pick. Which made no sense cause we need all the help we can get right now. Whenever the Spurs take Wemby out. Stats show that the team just fall apart.  Edi would’ve helped out the spurs tremendously. And since Wemby can move like a guard. He can play power forward sometimes when EDi is in the game at the same time he is.,2
You put Sarr too low in my opinion,2
This guy def doesn’t watch the wizards ☠️,1
how can you give alex sarr a C when everything you said about Risacher goes for him too??,1
"Reed Sheppard is in bust territory. He's literally been the worst player on the Rockets this season, and one of the worst rookies in general.",1
"To not have Jaylen Wells in the top 10 redraft made this whole video ridiculous 
Best Shooter 
2nd Best Defender
Starting for a top 5 team",1
Trippin Buzelis is Trash 🗑️,1
Salaun takes 6 minutes to get a shot off,1
I thought you were using Brook Lopez as an insult at first and was going to come in here blazing.,1
Yves Missi was leading in Rookie leader. And this guy doesn't even know Missi exists. That's when you know all these sports content creators are just idiots and saying craps,1
jaylen wells the roty isnt even here,1
It hasn't even been long enough to call it terrible give it 3 years first,1
Knhecht gets a A grade? After shooting sub league average in 3p% and playing some of the worst defense a wing can play? What are you talking about?,1
"It is too early... 
For Instance I comment one month later and Sarr has been 30/72 3pt for December and January and is now ranked as #1 on NBA rookie ladder (which by the way show this draft class is weak)... 
Wait for a year or two before reassessing the draft.",2
am I dumb or did he completely pass over Yves Missi. As a pelicans fan I think he’s top 5 redraft,1
3 weeks later Alex Sarr is looking much better. That's why you don't make these videos before its even halfway through their rookie seasons lol,2
Since this vid was 3 weeks ago this isnt to bad me personally i have Yves Missi very high going at least top 7 in a redraft,1
Buzzi vert out of 10?? THATS BULLSHIT,1
Kelal ware draft grade is bad. Could be better id say. The developing him. Him not getting playing time should not make for a bad draft grade.,2
Not having jaylon wells in your top 10 redraft is criminal at this point,1
Wells and Missi??? No top 10?,1
Where the fuck is jaylen wells in tne redraft should be one,1
"idk why people call this draft class so terrible, let’s see u play.",1
no jaylen wells?,1
absurd not to have yves missi in your top 10! good video otherwise,1
"When he likes the pick, he plays 
hi-lights in the background instead of their lowlights. Lol anyone else notice this?",2
The fact you didn’t put Missi in this video makes it lose a lot of credibility.,2
No Jaylen wells this list is trash 🗑️,1
no MISSI ???? dude is ballin,1
Wells over knecht anyday of the week i would prefer consistency and wells is alot better of a defender,2
I was screaming from the roof tops that Sarr was terrible but no one wanted to listen 😭 seeing him play so many times in person being from Perth he looked so bad out there in our nbl what made anyone think he would be an nba ready player.,1
What a stupid video title.,1
I would never draft Jared McCain 💅,1
"C'mon now, Ja'Kobe Walter is ballin out.  Don't be sleepin' on him.",1
U speed up your voice?,1
The lottery is rigged by Silver and Bron could end up in prison and TV ratings are tanking.,1
Do the regrade after the season is over. The season is far from being over,2
"Sorry lad, I stop watching at the A for Zach Edey. Probably there is a reason that very tall players don't play at NBA",1
I have a hard time not putting Missi in the top-10. I’d put him in over Salaun.,2
Jared McCain is not above castle,2
Atlanta Hawks biggest MISTAKE not DRAFT Bronny James Jr in 1st overall pick 😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅😂😅,1
Why most the highlights misses for reed and sarr,2
"hmm you heard the ""why isn't the american payer n°1""",1
Embarrassing to leave out the rookie who’s leading the class in double-doubles…,1
"No way you made a redraft and completely forgot last month's Rookie of the Month in Jaylen Wells...didn't even give any love for the Grizzlies drafting him at like #40

12 PPG hitting 38% of his threes as an early second rounder lol",1
Stopping that high in the draft is some basic ass shit. Yves Missi was one of the biggest steals.,2
People laughed at the Sixers taking McCain over Knecht. Who's laughing now?? lol,1
"DID YOU SEE YVES MISSI PLAYNG BRO
WTF",1
"I would not go that hard on Sarr considering the  ""leaders"" of your team are Poole and Kuzma. Doesn't exactly set you for success.",2
i will give you an INC grade for not doing the whole 1st round.,1
Knecht is  traffic cone on defense.,2
You need to move your image into a corner and not block the video.,1
Jared McCain ROTY also he's a YouTuber that right there makes you a #1 top guy in the 2024 draft. 🏀👏,1
Not sure how Jaylen Wells is not a top 10 pick. He literally guards the best player on the other team as a rookie and shoots lights out.,2
Totally agree about Reed. Wish he would’ve gone to a team that could give him minutes but it is what it is,1
Do you think Edey will actually become a rim protector on the level of Brook Lopez cause that is at least half of Brook’s value,2
I don't trust 76ers point guard hype bc what they said from out of there own mouth with Michael Carter Williams,1
No mention of Bronny James?,1
McCain and Knecht are overrated bc they got good spots on top heavy teams.,2
Hello where is Wells,1
Ryan Dunn snubbed,1
Dalton Knecht could go 2 or 3? No he couldn't. What a horrible take man. Not a god damn chance.,1
This class is still very weak it’s actually going exactly like they said not any SUPERSTAR/All Star players but I do see a lot of good Starters maybe fringe level all stars.,2
"This guy needs to watch Missi's highlights against the Spurs. Steal...coast to coast...eurostep slam @ 6'-11"" come on now ....show me a better rookie highlight",1
Its barely been a season for fucks sake i hate casuals,1
Give the Kings a F... Monte McNair taking Carter was a terrible pick and Carter better be amazing to justify to stupidity of the pick.,1
Just cause McCain and dalton have played by far the best doesn’t mean they’re by far the best prospects. No shot they go 1 and 2 in a redraft lol Sarr prolly still goes one ily but what is this reactionary ass video lmao,1
My biggest flex in life was always saying people were underrating this class. No idea why it was talked up to be one of the worst of all time.,1
I didnt even watch I just disliked the video,2
Wearing a Magic shirt but stopping at 17 right before the Magics pick is disgusting. Take off that shirt you phony,1
Tokyo’s video is 2 years too early,2
Yves Missi not listed???,1
Ya gotta pray Zach Edey develops a shot like brook Lopez look at yourself in the mirror he’s never gonna be close to wemby,1
Spurs gonna be unstoppable,1
Dalton Knecht is 23 years old... It is just not worth it to compare him to a 19 years old prospect.,2
"Sheppard grading above Sarr is ludicrous.  Sarr's grade I get but Sheppard has been miserable so far, Houston is getting almost nothing from him.",2
"Nah Sarr gets wayyyy too much hate, he averages 2 blocks a game a rookie? Hes shown flashed of shooting and being a lob threat? As far as rookies go he’s literally been one of the best your absolutely trippin bro",1
Saying Castle could go as high as 2 was laughable considering he's an inefficient shot jacker He's not a great shooter and sure he might get you 12 to 15 points but he's going to need 12 to 15 shots to get those points.,2
Those Top picks French players are Terrible,1
Alex sarr shooting too much threes,2
"I don’t understand your logic behind McCain number 1 in the redraft. You clearly laid out the reason Atlanta chose Zacc but then went against that by having them take Jared number one. McCain doesn’t fit what Atlanta is trying to do defensively. Yes, he’s out producing Zacc statistically so far, but it’s team identity you probably should be looking at?! 

Also, side note…. So many 🏀 YouTubers are going crazy on picks 16/17… I’ve been watching basketball a long time… I can remember a lot of people back in ‘09 saying “Brandon Jennings is the greatest thing since sliced bread…” hahaha let’s let not get ahead of ourselves. 

All of this to say - Atlanta wouldn’t choose McCain #1 in a redraft lol",1
Idiot that boy from spurs is the real deal...that  one from phily is a pretender,1
No mention of Yves Missi at 21?,1
"That right KNECHT 4 doNT play games with him he is the game lol 37pts for a rookie, LAKERS NATION",1
Does Washington regret not having taken Edey at #2 yet?,1
The only thing terrible related to this year’s draft were the takes before the event and during Summer League.,1
"As a Grizzlies fan getting Zach Edey, Jaylen Wells, GG Jackson, Walker Kessler (Traded), Santi Aldama, Vince Williams, Trey Murphy (Traded), and Desmond Bane over the last 4 years is insane in the drafts including 2nd rounders is insane! They never miss on picks.",1
My bro did Yves Missi dirty,1
Knecht has sucked three games in a row.   The league may have him figured out,1
You create a redraft that doesn't include YVES MISSI wow!That is wild...Yves could small all this guys and he is having already 6 DOUBLE DOUBLES ahead of all other players by far,1
it has been 2 months lol,1
He stopped right before Tristan Da Silva 😢,1
Yves Missi???,1
It's too early. Mike Conley was a bust his 1st 4-5 years,2
"You can't fault anyone who was drafted by the Wizards until they've been away from the franchise for at least twice the time they were with the Wizards and, of course, once they've gone through a complete year of therapy from the American Trauma Victims Association or other evidence-based cognitive behavioral therapy group.",1
Wells????,1
Jaylen Wells?,1
No Ajay Mitchell? Smh,1
Bruh did you not remember Jaylen Wells??,1
Dalton def number 1,1
Re-grading after not even halfway through their rookie season 💀 not taking this shit serious at all lmao,1
No love for Yves Missi??,1
Too early for this especially for a class like this,2
